# Customer Churn & Retention Analysis using SQL

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn and retention using SQL on retail transaction data.
The objective is to identify inactive customers, analyze churn patterns, and evaluate revenue impact due to churn.

## Business Problem
Customer retention is critical for business growth.
This analysis helps answer:
- Which customers are no longer active?
- How long customers stay engaged after their first purchase?
- Which customer segments have higher churn?
- How much revenue is lost due to churn?

## Dataset
- Source: Superstore retail transaction dataset
- Data includes customers, orders, and sales information
- Same dataset reused for deeper analytical insights

## Key Analysis Performed
- Identified churned customers based on last purchase date
- Calculated churn by customer segment
- Performed cohort analysis based on first order month
- Estimated revenue loss from churned customers

## SQL Concepts Used
- JOINs
- GROUP BY and aggregations
- Date functions (GETDATE, DATEADD, DATEDIFF)
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Window functions

## Tools
- SQL Server
- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

## Outcome
This project demonstrates the ability to solve real business problems related to customer retention using SQL.
